# Covid19_Tableau-Dashboard
In this project, I worked with a dataset tracking COVID-19 cases across the globe to build several key visualizations for an animated dashboard. The visualizations include time series charts to show the progression of cases over time, geographic maps to display the spread of the virus by region, and bar charts to compare case numbers across different countries. By integrating these visualizations into an animated dashboard, I was able to create a dynamic and informative tool that highlights trends and patterns in COVID-19 data, providing valuable insights into the global impact of the pandemic.
